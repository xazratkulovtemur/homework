break statement stops the loop while continue statement just skips the loop

while loop runs until condition is True, while for loop runs in sequence, and stops in its end

if i have two seqeunce inside by inside, for example, i have n classes and in each class m students, and i want to create a date for each students, classifiying their classes, i use nested loops

for i in range(1,n+1)
    for j in range(1,m+1)
